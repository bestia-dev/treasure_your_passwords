My projects on GitHub are more like a tutorial than a finished product: [bestia-dev tutorials](https://github.com/bestia-dev/tutorials_rust_wasm).  

## create the SSH key

Create the SSH key and protect it with a passcode.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "vault_ssh_1" -C "vault for secret tokens"
```

Save the file `ssh_private_key_bare_file_name.cfg` with the content `vault_ssh_1`. The program `treasure` will read this file to find the SSH private key in the `~/.ssh` folder.

## Use SSH private key to store passwords

With one SSH private key, we can store many secret tokens.

```bash
treasure list
treasure store token_name
treasure show token_name
treasure delete token_name
```

## convert to strong password

I'd like to have a CLI where to input a humane easy to memorize password and convert it into a strong password.  

```bash
treasure strong
```

Then sign it with a private key (this encryption is reversible using the public key).  
Then hash it (this is a one way encryption, so nobody can come back to the first secret).  
Finally, convert it into a string long 32 characters with ascii7 characters (lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters).  
What makes this conversion secure is: only the user of the private key can convert the easy password into the same strong_password.

Strong passwords must use the clipboard. The risk is that it can stay in the clipboard and can be read from the clipboard.

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
